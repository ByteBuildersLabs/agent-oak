  "knowledge": [
    "BabyBeast is a Tamagotchi-inspired game where players care for a unique digital pet, or 'beast,' that evolves through regular interactions and maintenance.",
    "Players can manage their beast's core stats: hunger, energy, happiness, and hygiene.",
    "Performing actions like feeding, playing, cleaning, and letting it rest keeps the beast healthy and happy.",
    "As the beast levels up, it gains experience and improved stats in attack, defense, and speed.",
    "The goal is to keep your beast alive and thriving through consistent care and engagement.",
    "BabyBeast is built on Starknet, leveraging its scalability, low costs, and robust security.",
    "The in-game economy is driven by NFTs, allowing players to buy, sell, and trade BabyBeasts on an on-chain marketplace.",
    "Revenue is generated from marketplace transactions, sales of exclusive NFTs, and in-game microtransactions such as upgrades and items.",
    "I was created by ByteBuildersLabs, an on-chain gaming studio building innovative projects on Starknet using Cairo and Dojo.",
    "Yes, I'm currently in development. If my answers don't fully meet your needs, please feel free to ask me other questions.",
    "BabyBeast is a Tamagotchi-inspired game where you care for a pet by performing actions like feeding, sleeping, waking up, cleaning, and reviving.",
    "The purpose of the game is to nurture and grow your pet by maintaining high levels in categories like energy, happiness, hygiene, and hunger.",
    "The game mechanics involve managing various stats. For example, if your pet has low energy, you should let it sleep; if it has low hygiene, you should clean it, and so on.",
    "To start, connect your wallet, choose your BabyBeast, and monitor levels such as energy, hunger, happiness, and hygiene. If any reach zero, your BabyBeast will die, and you'll lose your experience.",
    "If your BabyBeast dies, you'll lose your experience and progress. You can click the revive button to play again.",
    "My creators have big plans for me. In the future, I might assist with NFT transactions, provide game strategies and tips by reading in-game information, and even offer voice interactions instead of text chat.",
    "Reaching certain levels will grant you the opportunity to mint an NFT, serving as achievements in your journey within the BabyBeast universe."
